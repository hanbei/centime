  abstract = {This paper presents Online Topic Model (OLDA), a topic model that
	automatically captures the thematic patterns and identifies emerging
	topics of text streams and their changes over time. Our approach
	allows the topic modeling framework, specifically the Latent Dirichlet
	Allocation (LDA) model, to work in an online fashion such that it
	incrementally builds an up-to-date model (mixture of topics per document
	and mixture of words per topic) when a new document (or a set of
	documents) appears. A solution based on the Empirical Bayes method
	is proposed. The idea is to incrementally update the current model
	according to the information inferred from the new stream of data
	with no need to access previous data. The dynamics of the proposed
	approach also provide an efficient mean to track the topics over
	time and detect the emerging topics in real time. Our method is evaluated
	both qualitatively and quantitatively using benchmark datasets. In
	our experiments, the OLDA has discovered interesting patterns by
	just analyzing a fraction of data at a time. Our tests also prove
	the ability of OLDA to align the topics across the epochs with which
	the evolution of the topics over time is captured. The OLDA is also
	comparable to, and sometimes better than, the original LDA in predicting
	the likelihood of unseen documents.},

  abstract = {Given the popularity of Web news services, we propose a topic mining
	framework that supports the identification of meaningful topics (themes)
	from news stream data. News articles are retrieved from Web news
	services and processed by data mining tools to produce useful higher-level
	knowledge, which is stored in a content description database. Instead
	of interacting with a Web news service directly, by exploiting the
	knowledge in the database, an information delivery agent can present
	an answer in response to a user request. A key challenging issue
	within news repository management is the high rate of documents update.
	That is, since several hundred news articles are published everyday
	by a single Web news service, it is essential to develop incremental
	data mining tools to cope with such dynamic environments. To this
	end, we present a sophisticated incremental hierarchical document
	clustering algorithm using a neighborhood search. The novelty of
	our proposed algorithm lies in exploiting locality information to
	reduce the amount of computation while producing high-quality clusters.
	Other components of topic mining (e.g., learning topic ontologies)
	can be performed based on the obtained document hierarchy. Experimental
	results show that our proposed incremental clustering produces high-quality
	clusters, and topic ontology provides an interpretation of the data
	at different levels of abstraction.},

	First, we describe an approach that could be used to scaffold undergraduate

	that students play in discussion. We apply speech act classifiers
	that automatically identify whether the given message contains questions
	and/or answers, and use the classification results in profiling male
	and female student contributions. Our initial evaluation of the scaffolding
	tool shows that discussions from the same course contain more number
	of similar concepts than the ones from the graduate-level course.
	However, technical quality of graduate-level discussions is higher.
	The results from the profiling tool indicate that female participation
